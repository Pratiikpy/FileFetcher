# Tutorial
To create this application, I embarked on a journey through the wonderful world of PyQt5, a powerful toolkit for building feature-rich GUI applications. With the help of an online tutorial, I learned how to set up a basic window, add widgets like labels, line edits, and buttons, and connect signals to slots.

Along the way, I added some custom logic to enable or disable the "Download" button based on the user's input, as well as a dropdown menu for selecting the file type. I also incorporated the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to handle the actual file download process.

But my work didn't stop there. I wanted to give the application a polished and professional look, so I added some CSS styling and a snazzy window icon using the QtGui.QIcon class. And voila! The File Downloader was born.

# Usage
Using this application is a breeze. Simply enter the URL of the file you want to download, choose a location to save it, and select the file type from the dropdown menu. If the file is behind a login, you can enter your username and password in the optional fields. Then, just hit the "Download" button and sit back as the magic happens.

# Creative Additions
In addition to the functionalities described above, I made sure to add a touch of creativity to the application. I chose a sleek and modern color scheme, added some subtle animations, and made the overall user experience as smooth as possible. I hope you enjoy using this application as much as I enjoyed building it!
